# Modern Javascript Application
### What
This is an exercise about the application of modern javascript. In the previous exercise we had to make a [weather app](https://willemdt369.github.io/the-modern-javascript-application/index.html), which in this exercise has gone through the process of applying modern javascript to. 
### Objectives

The following techniques were the must-have-dones:
- Refractor the code in as many functions as possible
- Using modules
### How
